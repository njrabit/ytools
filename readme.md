# What the hell is ytools?

I'm sad you asked.  Basically, ytools is just a filthy bucket of scripts that let me jump between all my various filthy unix environments and not really care too much which one I'm on.  When I type ```yinstall``` it works whether I'm on Mac OS-X, Arch, Debian, Gentoo, etc.

# That's stupid, why not just learn the native commands?

No, you're stupid.

# Ha-ha, but no, really.

I type very quickly.  I'm told I have the best typing in the world.  What I don't like is clumsy shell commands.  ```brew``` is not bad.  ```zypper``` rolls off the fingers pretty well.  ```yum``` is just obnoxious, one-handed and ugly.  And ```pacman``` is the worst, a real piece of work.  I mean, the package manager is great, maybe the best ever, but ```pacman -Ss``` to search and ```pacman -S``` to install?  Really, does the person who comes up with these commands actually type?

# You know, I completely see your point.  So how do I use it?

Uhh, we're still working on that.  I'll have my people contact your people to work this out.

# Honk, Honk!

What? I've been talking to a Canadian Goose all this time.
